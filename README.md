# DC-Geared-motor-with-encoder-MPU6050
Connect an N20 micro DC geared motor to an L293D motor driver and control its rotation using a joystick. The motor's encoder will provide rotation angle and position data, displayed on a PC screen. Additionally, attach an MPU6050 module to the motor shaft to provide rotation data for comparison with the encoder readings, also displayed on the PC.
